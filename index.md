Hi!

Welcome to our reading group. Please join us this summer to understand and learn about deep learning from a researcher's point of view. We will be doing book readings, paper readings, code demos, guest lectures and more importantly, discussing and updating the latest research from deep-learning community.

We are first planning to finish the book by Ian Goodfellow, [deeplearningbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and cover widely used deep learning architectures in June and then move to [Matrix Computation book](http://web.mit.edu/ehliu/Public/sclark/Golub%20G.H.,%20Van%20Loan%20C.F.-%20Matrix%20Computations.pdf) in mid July.

Please find the dicussion forum [here](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dlta-reading). 

**All are welcome**

### Time and Location

We will be meeting **Tuesdays** and **Fridays** from **4:30 pm** to **5:30 pm** in **MSC Conference room 4th floor**.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
